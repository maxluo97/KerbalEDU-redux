#Introduction
This document will serve as reference material for instructors to make the best of KSP as an educational tool. As such, it will cover "technical" topics that are not relevant to a student's learning - e.g. creating objects and vehicles, editing orbits, etc. While it will highlight certain gameplay tricks or advanced mechanics to better your instruction, it is **not** intended to serve as a base tutorial on how to play the game. For that, I suggest either working through the game's built-in tutorials (found under Start Game > Training from the main menu), and/or taking time to actually play through the game yourself.

Before beginning to use KSP for educational purposes, there is a small amount of initial setup to do. This document will work under the assumption that you will be using the game's Sandbox mode, which gives users full access to all parts without having to progress and unlock them.

#Setup
1. Install KSP to your disk from the distribution platform of your choice.

2. From the game's main menu, go to Settings and enable "Advanced Tweakables". This is a setting that allows for more granular control over gameplay elements both in flight and in vehicle construction via the right-click context menu.

3. Begin creating the save file you intend to use for instruction, under Start Game > Start New. If it is relevant to you, before you click "Start!", enable Plasma Blackout under Difficulty Options > Advanced. This setting makes robotic cores lose connection to ground control when flying through atmospheric plasma (i.e. upon planetary entry). If it is relevant to you, this is also where you can enable "Require Signal for Control", which requires a relay network to be set up between robotic spacecraft and ground control in order to maintain any sort of control over the spacecraft. These settings can also be enabled/disabled in-game.
