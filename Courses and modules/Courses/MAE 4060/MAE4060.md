# MAE 4060

## Introduction

This set of modules is a collection of ideas related to Cornell University's MAE 4060: Introduction to Spaceflight Mechanics. While it is not likely rigorous enough to fully replace any individual class session, it should be able to provide a visual and intuitive supplement to the work done in class. Understanding that MAE 4060 and 4160, combined, deal with both the physics of orbits and the engineering of spacecraft, the following details several modules to implement throughout the course, with a gently suggested throughline to explore "progression" through these modules.

## Module 1: trajectories in space

Two approaches to thinking about trajectories are to either 1) expand one's knowledge of ground-based projectile motion in the presence of gravity, or 2) start infinitely far from a gravitational body and observe what happens when objects are released from rest. This module will explore both concepts.

### Module 1a: going up into space

Students should become familiar with the idea that many concepts in orbital mechanics are independent of mass. The following are a sample set of questions that students may be expected to answer, whether as an in-class worksheet or for homework. 

---

_Neglect the effects of air resistance in all questions unless otherwise specified._

_1. A golf ball (mass: 45.9g) falls 25 m off a bridge from rest. What is the velocity of the golf ball right before it hits the ground?
2. A brick (mass: 2.27 kg) falls from the same bridge. What is the velocity of the brick right before it hits the ground?
3. A bus (mass: 12,000 kg) falls from the same bridge. What is the velocity of the brick right before it hits the ground?_

_What are the effects of mass on velocity? What are the effects of velocity on trajectory?_

_How much energy does each object have?_

_The same three objects are now horizontally pushed from the same bridge at 10 m/s. What is the velocity of each object when it hits the ground?_

_Now that each object has some horizontal velocity, do the effects of mass change? Do the trajectories change? What do you think would happen if we started high enough and went fast enough that we never touched the ground?_

---

While many parts of orbital mechanics can be described without considering mass, not all parts can be. For example, while it may be useful to describe an object's energy in terms of its specific energy (thus removing mass from the picture), this fails to reflect how much true energy it takes to move an object. Indeed, although trajectories do not change for objects of different masses, the energy it takes to move objects to that point does. Completing this worksheet, therefore, should have two conclusions: 1) objects in space of different mass will move similarly if other parameters are similar, but 2) it takes more energy to get heavier objects there in the first place.

### Module 1b: considering energy

Module 1a began by expanding on prior knowledge that students should have gained through high school physics courses or early undergraduate physics courses, by taking ballistic trajectories and asking the question of what happens if something starts from the ground and enters orbit. Now, module 1b will ask the opposite: what happens if something enters orbit from infinitely far away? The suggested plan for this submodule is to visually explore these ideas in KSP, leading to a derivation of the vis-viva equation.

_In KSP, create an object of interest, then place it in a very high circular orbit around any body that is not the sun, and ideally without any moons (or, ensure that your object's trajectory never enters a moon's sphere of influence). Then, reduce the object's prograde velocity until it is zero. The object now represents an object that is brought within the sphere of influence of the central body from infinitely far away; note that the object will have a nonzero velocity as the central body slowly exerts its gravity on it. Create a save point here so that you can return to this moment._

_Using time warp controls, demonstrate how the object's velocity increases as the object approaches the central body; this should be intuitive to students._

_Return to your save point, with the object being brought into the central body's sphere of influence from infinitely far away. Add small adjustments to the prograde velocity at various altitudes, to demonstrate the effects on the object's trajectory. Explore elliptical orbits and circular orbits first; with a sufficiently low altitude, clever manipulation of trajectory, and the orbital camera, it is also possible to observe how parabolic arcs as seen from the ground are really elliptical orbits whose trajectories terminate at sea level. Lastly, explore hyperbolic trajectories._

_Time allowing, repeat the above with objects of different mass, observing how velocity is the same for two objects of different mass under the same conditions._

This is now a good time to derive **the vis-viva equation**.

## Module 2: Basic spacecraft engineering considerations

Following the initial discussion of science, we can pivot now into an initial discussion of engineering. Having just established that the mass of the lighter object in a restricted two-body problem has no bearing on its parameters, we can now ask students to consider why cannot disregard mass in entirety.

Following Module 1a's somewhat trivial realization that moving larger objects requires larger amounts of energy, we translate this into spacecraft engineering speak: heavier spacecraft require more powerful propulsion systems.

Depending on the pace of the class, the following KSP section may not be necessary.

---

_In the VAB, create a propulsion subsystem, consisting of a liquid fuel tank and a liquid fuel engine. Save this subsystem (NOTE: ADD HOW-TO ON MAKING SUBSYSTEMS). Then, create two or three spacecraft of visually different masses, but without any propulsion system. Attach the previously constructed propulsion subsystem to each spacecraft; save each spacecraft with unique, identifying names._

_There are several ways to demonstrate figures of merit for propulsion systems. One way is to describe the available delta-V; however, at this stage, students may not yet have been exposed to delta-V as a concept. If you decide that it is appropriate to use delta-V as an unexplained figure of merit to be discussed later, place each spacecraft in the same orbit and use KSP's built-in delta-V calculator to show how thrust, TWR, and delta-V change; but Isp and firing time do not._

_If you prefer a visual representation of figure of merit, have all three spacecraft burn prograde until all propellant is expelled. Compare the resulting apoapsis._

---

At this point, we can open up more technical descriptions of spacecraft performance metrics. Discuss specific impulse, exit velocity, etc., moving to deriving the **rocket equation**. Note some assumptions like delta-V as a result of instantaneous burn. Also note the difference between delta-V requirements versus delta-V ability (i.e. how much delta-V is needed for a maneuver versus how much delta-V a spacecraft is capable of producing).

Whether it is useful to further discuss other parameters in more mathematical depth (thrust, e.g.) is up to you. However, it *is* perhaps useful to ask if there's a way to get better performance out of the same mass fractions. In other words, given a particular spacecraft and given a particular amount of propellant, how would one improve either thrust or Isp? Furthermore, is it possible to maximize both, and if not, under what circumstances might it be preferred to optimize for one or the other?

A KSP addendum is presented below:

---

_Build one spacecraft with a central fuel tank and four radially symmetric fuel tanks in a spoke-and-wheel design (SCREENSHOT), thus providing five attachment points for engines. Using the "remove from symmetry" tool, place three types of engines: one in the middle, and two identical engines on opposing sides of the "wheel". Configure stages or action groups (INCLUDE NOTE ON ACTION GROUPS) so that you are able to turn individual engines on or off; it is recommended to have three action groups, each key corresponding to toggling a type of engine on/off._

_Having different types of engines on the same spacecraft, sharing the same masses, is a direct way to compare performance metrics with these mass fractions held constant. As with the previous KSP section, you can make performance comparisons either by making observations about the numeric performance metrics, or by making three copies of the same spacecraft and comparing apoapsis heights when using different engines._

## Module 3: perturbations and orbit manipulation

This module is disconnected from the previous two modules. It serves to better visualize how an orbit evolves as different maneuvers are executed. After introducing perturbations and/or maneuvers, ask students to demonstrate how these perturbations/manuevers affect an orbit. Then, if needed, do the following KSP section:

---

_Construct a spacecraft with sufficient delta-V for long demonstrations (e.g. one powered with an electric propulsion system). Place this spacecraft in any desired orbit, away from moons and the atmosphere. Using the built-in SAS buttons, observe how burning in various directions affects the resulting orbit._
