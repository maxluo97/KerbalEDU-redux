# Spacecraft component visual identification

To help get students thinking about spacecraft from a system engineering point of view, build a reasonable spacecraft in the VAB, put it in orbit, and have students attempt to identify different components by sight. This exercise is mainly to encourage students to think, "What does a spacecraft require to be successful?"
The spacecraft in question can be built to represent any era of space you desire (e.g. modern robotic spacecraft vs. Apollo era). There is no harm in simplifying construction for the sake of the lesson material, as the point of the exercise is to have students become more aware of systems anyway.

One useful addendum is to ask students what systems may be required that are NOT visible (e.g. life support).

Below is a sample Apollo-ish spacecraft built in KSP.
